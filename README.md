# Devise with Omniauth and multiple service providers

This application is based on the [Railscasts #235 Devise and OmniAuth (Revised)](http://railscasts.com/episodes/235-devise-and-omniauth-revised) and the original Railscasts [#235 OmniAuth Part 1](http://railscasts.com/episodes/235-omniauth-part-1) and [#236 OmniAuth Part 2](http://railscasts.com/episodes/236-omniauth-part-2). It uses omniauth-linkedin and omniauth-twitter gems but can be configured to add others such as Facebook, Foursquare and others. See a good list with links to the gems at [www.omniauth.org](http://www.omniauth.org/) .
